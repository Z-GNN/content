    "Description": "BBTools is a suite of fast, multithreaded bioinformatics tools designed for analysis of DNA and RNA sequence data.BBTools can handle common sequencing file formats such as fastq, fasta, sam, scarf, fasta+qual, compressed or raw,with autodetection of quality encoding and interleaving. It is written in Java and works on any platform supportingJava, including Linux, MacOS, and Microsoft Windows and Linux; there are no dependencies other than Java (version7 or higher). Program descriptions and options are shown when running the shell scripts with no parameters.",
