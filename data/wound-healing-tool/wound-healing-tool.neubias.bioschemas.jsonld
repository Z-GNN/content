  "http://schema.org/description": "<p>The wound healing tool measures the area of a wound in a time series of images of cellular tissue. The tool will measure the area of the wound, i.e. the area that does not contain tissue, in each image. The segmentation is based on the fact that the image is more homogeneous in the region of the wound as in the region of the tissue. Via the options, one of two methods to detect the empty area, can be selected. The first uses edge detection, the second a variance filter. Holes in the detected tissue are filled using morphological operations.</p>\r\n",
