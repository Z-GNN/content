  "http://schema.org/description": "<p>Morphological Segmentation is an ImageJ/Fiji plugin that combines morphological operations, such as extended minima and morphological gradient, with watershed flooding algorithms to segment grayscale images of any type (8, 16 and 32-bit) in 2D and 3D. Morphological Segmentation runs on any open grayscale image, single 2D image or (3D) stack. If no image is open when calling the plugin, an Open dialog will pop up. The user can pan, zoom in and out, or scroll between slices (if the input image is a stack) in the main canvas as if it were any other ImageJ window. On the left side of the canvas there are three panels of parameters, one for the input image, one with the watershed parameters and one for the output options. All buttons, checkboxes and input panels contain a short explanation of their functionality that is displayed when the cursor lingers over them. Image pre-processing: some pre-processing is included in the plugin to facilitate the segmentation task. However, other pre-preprocessing may be required depending on the input image. It is up to the user to decide what filtering may be most appropriate upstream.</p>\r\n",
