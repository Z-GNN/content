While several tools and advanced analysis pipelines are available, some require programming skills and others lack the support for many important features that enable a more comprehensive data analysis. There is thus, a need for a guided and easy to use comprehensive RNA-Seq data platform, which integrates the state of the art analysis workflow. Results We present the tool Shiny-Seq, which provides a guided and easy to use comprehensive RNA-Seq data analysis pipeline",
