  "http://schema.org/description": "<p>This module identifies objects that are contained within in a grid pattern, allowing you to measure the objects using&nbsp;Measure&nbsp;modules. It requires you to have defined a grid earlier in the pipeline, using the&nbsp;DefineGrid&nbsp;module. For several of the automatic options, you will need to enter the names of previously identified objects. Typically, this module is used to refine locations and/or shapes of objects of interest that you roughly identified in a previous&nbsp;Identify&nbsp;module. Within this module, objects are re-numbered according to the grid definitions rather than their original numbering from the earlier&nbsp;Identify&nbsp;module. If placing the objects within the grid is impossible for some reason (the grid compartments are too close together to fit the proper sized circles, for example) the grid will fail and processing will be canceled unless you choose to re-use a grid from a previous successful image cycle.</p>\r\n",
