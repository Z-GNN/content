  description: genetic variant annotation and effect prediction toolbox - tool
  long_description: " \"We are all different!\" Geneticists agree to this.\n Even\
    \ twins, who are said to be identical are on a molecular\n level only \"mostly\"\
    \ identical. And even within the exact same individual,\n healthy cells acquire\
    \ mutations such that we are all genetic mosaics.\n Changes to individual cells\
    \ may be induced by environmental factors,\n e.g. like UV light, or happen sporadically\
    \ as mishaps during cellular\n divisions.\n .\n Because there are so many genetic\
    \ differences, and most have just no\n particular meaning for the development\
    \ of a phenotype, i.e. most have no\n effect, it would be nice to have heuristics\
    \ implemented that direct the\n researcher towards single-nucleotide polymorphisms\
    \ (SNPs) that are most\n likely to be relevant. This identifies the gene that\
    \ causes or contributes\n to, e.g, an illness, and possibly also genes that are\
    \ affected by that\n change. Such mechanistic understanding of a disease, particularly\
    \ when\n multiple genes and multiple genetic variants are contributing to the\n\
    \ then \"polygenic\" phenotype, is at the onset of drug development and\n increasingly\
    \ also for selecting individualized therapies in the clinic.\n .\n SnpEff is a\
    \ variant annotation and effect prediction tool. It annotates\n and predicts the\
    \ effects of variants on genes (such as amino acid\n changes).\n The inputs are\
    \ predicted variants (SNPs, insertions, deletions and\n MNPs). The input file\
    \ is usually obtained as a result of a sequencing\n experiment, and it is usually\
    \ in variant call format (VCF).\n .\n SnpEff analyzes the input variants. It annotates\
    \ the variants and\n calculates the effects they produce on known genes (e.g.\
    \ amino acid\n changes).\n .\n This package contains the command line tool.\n"
