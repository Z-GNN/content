      "sc:description": "Soft-edge Assisted Network for Single Image Super-Resolution.\n\nThe task of single image super-resolution (SISR) is a highly ill-posed inverse problem since reconstructing the highfrequency details from a low-resolution image is challenging. Most previous CNN-based super-resolution (SR) methods tend to directly learn the mapping from the low-resolution image to the high-resolution image through some complex convolutional neural networks. However, the method of blindly increasing the depth of the network is not the best choice because the performance improvement of such methods is marginal but the computational cost is huge. A more efficient method is to integrate the image prior knowledge into the model to assist the image reconstruction. Indeed, the soft-edge has been widely applied in many computer vision tasks as the role of an important image feature",
