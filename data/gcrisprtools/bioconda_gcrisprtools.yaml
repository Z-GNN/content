biotools_id: gcrisprtools
description: Set of tools for evaluating pooled high-throughput screening experiments,
  typically employing CRISPR/Cas9 or shRNA expression cassettes. Contains methods
  for interrogating library and cassette behavior within an experiment, identifying
  differentially abundant cassettes, aggregating signals to identify candidate targets
  for empirical validation, hypothesis testing, and comprehensive reporting. Version
  2.0 extends these applications to include a variety of tools for contextualizing
  and integrating signals across many experiments, incorporates extended signal enrichment
  methodologies via the "sparrow" package, and streamlines many formal requirements
  to aid in interpretablity.
