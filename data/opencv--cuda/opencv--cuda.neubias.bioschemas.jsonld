  "http://schema.org/description": "<p>The OpenCV CUDA module is a set of classes and functions to utilize CUDA computational capabilities. It is implemented using NVIDIA* CUDA* Runtime API and supports only NVIDIA GPUs. The OpenCV CUDA module includes utility functions, low-level vision primitives, and high-level algorithms. The utility functions and low-level primitives provide a powerful infrastructure for developing fast vision algorithms taking advantage of CUDA whereas the high-level functionality includes some state-of-the-art algorithms (such as stereo correspondence, face and people detectors, and others) ready to be used by the application developers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The CUDA module is designed as a host-level API. This means that if you have pre-compiled OpenCV CUDA binaries, you are not required to have the CUDA Toolkit installed or write any extra code to make use of the CUDA.</p>\r\n",
