description: Logistic Factor Analysis is a method for a PCA analogue on Binomial data
  via estimation of latent structure in the natural parameter.  The main method estimates
  genetic population structure from genotype data.  There are also methods for estimating
  individual-specific allele frequencies using the population structure.  Lastly,
  a structured Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) test is developed, which quantifies
  the goodness of fit of the genotype data to the estimated population structure,
  via the estimated individual-specific allele frequencies (all of which generalizes
  traditional HWE tests).
