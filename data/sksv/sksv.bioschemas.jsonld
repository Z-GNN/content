      "sc:description": "SKSV is a ultrafast structural variation detection from circular consensus sequencing reads. Circular consensus sequencing (CCS) reads are promising for the comprehensive detection of structural variants (SVs). However, alignment-based SV calling pipelines are computationally intensive due to the generation of complete read-alignments and its post-processing. Herein, we propose a SKeleton-based analysis toolkit for Structural Variation detection (SKSV). Benchmarks on real and simulated datasets demonstrate that SKSV has an order of magnitude of faster speed than state-of-the-art SV calling ap-proaches, moreover, it enables to well-handle various types of SVs with higher F1 scores.",
