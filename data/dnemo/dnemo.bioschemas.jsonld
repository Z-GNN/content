      "sc:description": "A tool for quantification of mRNA and punctate structures in time-lapse images of single cells.\nABSTRACT Many biological processes are regulated by single molecules and molecular assemblies within cells that are visible by microscopy as punctate features, often diffraction limited. Here we present detecting-NEMO (dNEMO), a computational tool optimized for accurate and rapid measurement of fluorescent puncta in fixed-cell and time-lapse images. The spot detection algorithm uses the Ã  trous wavelet transform, a computationally inexpensive method that is robust to imaging noise. By combining automated with manual spot curation in the user interface, fluorescent puncta can be carefully selected and measured against their local background to extract high quality single-cell data. Integrated into the workflow are segmentation and spot-inspection tools that enable almost real-time interaction with images without time consuming pre-processing steps.",
