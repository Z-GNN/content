  "http://schema.org/description": "<p><span>Luigi is a Python module that helps you build complex pipelines of batch jobs. It handles dependency resolution, workflow management, visualization etc. It also comes with Hadoop support built in. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The purpose of Luigi is to address all the plumbing typically associated with long-running batch processes. You want to chain many tasks, automate them, and failures <em>will</em> happen. These tasks can be anything, but are typically long running things like <a href=\"http://hadoop.apache.org/\">Hadoop</a> jobs, dumping data to/from databases, running machine learning algorithms, or anything else.</p>\r\n",
