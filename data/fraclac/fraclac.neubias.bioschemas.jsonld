It is freely available software developed and maintained by our&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.csu.edu.au/faculty/science/cmhealth/staff/profiles/academic-staff/herbert-jelinek\">lab</a>&nbsp;at the School of Community Health, Faculty of Science, Charles Sturt University, Australia. The author of the software and project lead is also the author of this document (me, Audrey Karperien). The basic box counting algorithm was originally modified from&nbsp;<em>ImageJ</em>'s box counting algorithm and H. Jelinek's&nbsp;<em>NIH Image</em>&nbsp;plugin, and was further elaborated based on extensive research and development. The convex hull algorithm was provided by Thomas Roy, University of Alberta, Canada. As open source software, with the continuing help of a host of users and collaborators, FracLac has evolved to a suite of fractal analysis and morphology functions.</p>\r\n",
