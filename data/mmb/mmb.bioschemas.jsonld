  "sc:description": "Previously known as RNABuilder. The latter is available up to revision 2.2. We renamed the software since even some longtime users were unaware that the package now handles protein as well as RNA. Aside from the renaming, MMB 2.3 differs from RNABuilder 2.2 in two important ways. Release 2.3 has fully overhauled guts. It uses the BiopolymerClassContainer, a much cleaner programming construct which will make future upgrades and extensions more efficient.",
