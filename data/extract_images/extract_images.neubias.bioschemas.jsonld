  "http://schema.org/description": "A utility macro for the specified use of BioFormats plugin. Takes a folder of proprietary images formats (Zeiss zvi, lsm, czi or Nikon nd2) and extracts them to .tif images\r\n\r\nThe extracted images are located in a folder defined in the menu.\r\nOther options: reset spatial scales, reads ROIs, split channels, add stage position in the name.\r\n\r\n<!-- [previous text] This macro allows to batch convert .zvi multichannel time-lapse movies into .tif stacks. There are several options for processing and filtering. In particular, you can register the jitter due to small stage movements during acquisition. For this option to work you need to install Kang Li's Image Stabilizer plugin. -->\r\n\r\n**note**: The old name of the macro was \"ZVI Extractor\" and the data format was limited to ZVI, but the upgraded version includes more formats. \r\n\r\nRequires Bio-Formats plugin\r\n\r\n\r\n",
