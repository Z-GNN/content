      "sc:description": "A tool for quantitatively characterizing the morphology and growth of filamentous fungi.\n\nThe FFT represents a user-friendly tool that automatically characterizes several fungal phenotypes using images that can be obtained using basic imaging devices. The FFT can be used to study different fungal species, conditions and image scales and resolutions. Relying on simple built-in image analysis functions, the FFT is able to quantitatively characterize conidiation, conidia morphology and different aspects of the mycelium, including the growth area, number of hyphal tips and total length of the hyphae. In addition, we developed a function within the FFT that can detect and count traps developed by nematode-trapping fungi.",
