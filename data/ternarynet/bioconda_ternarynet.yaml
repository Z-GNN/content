description: 'Gene-regulatory network (GRN) modeling seeks to infer dependencies between
  genes and thereby provide insight into the regulatory relationships that exist within
  a cell. This package provides a computational Bayesian approach to GRN estimation
  from perturbation experiments using a ternary network model, in which gene expression
  is discretized into one of 3 states: up, unchanged, or down). The ternarynet package
  includes a parallel implementation of the replica exchange Monte Carlo algorithm
  for fitting network models, using MPI.'
