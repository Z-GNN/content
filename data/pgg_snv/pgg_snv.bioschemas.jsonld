Users can upload their local files with specific format (see readme and example at the top-right corner of each tool) generated by their own analysis to draw their figures as well as download them. The current version includes tools on (a) heatmap plot of population differentiation; (b) word map plot of allele frequency distributions; (c) manhattan plot of natural selection signals; and (d) heatmap plot for linkage disequilibrium analysis.",
