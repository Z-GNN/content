  "http://schema.org/description": "This workflow estimates (densely distributed) object counts by the density of objects in the image without performing segmentation or object detection. Current version only works for 2D images of roundish objects with similar sizes on relatively homogeneous background. Users should provide a few labels of background and objects (especially on clustered objects), and the tool predicts the density of objects on the entire image. Counting is then estimated by integrating the density values on the whole image or specified rectangular regions of interests.",
