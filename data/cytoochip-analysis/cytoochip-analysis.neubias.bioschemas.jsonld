  "http://schema.org/description": "<p>This macro is a plugin macro to the \"Intelligent Imaging\" workflow. It detects the Cytoo patterns (specific fluorsecence channel) and computes the occupancy (number of cells) of each pattern by analyzing the images of the DAPI channel. The analysis function can be easily extended to, for instance, only select the cells that are well spread on the patterns (by analyzing a third channel with a properly chosen marker of the cytoplasm).</p>\r\n",
