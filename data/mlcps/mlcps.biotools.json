    "description": "Machine Learning Cumulative Performance Score (MLcps), a novel evaluation metric for classification problems. MLcps integrates several pre-computed evaluation metrics into a unified score, enabling a comprehensive assessment of the trained model's strengths and weaknesses. We tested MLcps on four publicly available datasets, and the results demonstrate that MLcps provides a holistic evaluation of the model's robustness, ensuring a thorough understanding of its overall performance.",
