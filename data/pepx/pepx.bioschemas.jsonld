Complexes have been clustered based on their binding interfaces rather than sequence homology, providing a set of structurally diverse protein-peptide interactions. Each complex is annotated with both biological and structural information. Peptides are also annotated with naturally occurring backbone variations using fragment clusters from the BriX database to aid peptide design.",
