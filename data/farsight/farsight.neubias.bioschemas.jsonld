  "http://schema.org/description": "A General purpose image processing toolkit written in C++ based on ITK, VTK, Qt, and Boost. Main features: algorithms for cell segmentation, cell tracing, cell tracking, and vessel tracing. Registration and mosaicing algorithms for large scale datasets. Visualization tools actively linked to inspect and edit results.\r\nStrengths:\r\n- Open-source, free, multi platform, code is highly parallelized, uses git for version control\r\n- Large scale processing, also efficient visualization of such datasets.\r\n- Active learning module for classification\r\n- Most of the algorithms have been extended to handle 16-bit images, and 3D Images.\r\n- Possibility to create complex pipelines thanks to itÂ’s modular architecture\r\n- Editing tools are designed to save the editing operation which can later be used to validate the algorithms performance\r\n- Advance preprocessing algorithms like curvelets, tensor voting, and wrappers around ITK-algorithms\r\n- Multiple viewers included to inspect results such as: Histograms, scatter plots, tables, kymograph, all of them linked together.\r\n- Strong emphasis to work on multichannel images (up to 40 channels)\r\n- Rich number of cell features included \r\nWeakness:\r\n- GUI is suboptimal compared to commercial packages.\r\n- Tracking module requires an external library CPLEX.\r\n- No support for brightfield images\r\n- No native interoperability with other software packages\r\n- More documentation needed / tutorial needed\r\n",
