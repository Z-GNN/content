      "sc:description": "BedtoolsR is an R package that provides a convenient wrapper for bedtools functions allowing for the documentation and use of them from within the R programming environment, using standard R data types. It uses the version of bedtools installed on your system, rather than its own version, such that you should be able to use it interchangeably from the command line or within R. It also includes additional functionality including the ability to provide either file paths or R objects as inputs and outputs. Bedtoolsr automatically detects the format of the input/output and handles it accordingly.",
