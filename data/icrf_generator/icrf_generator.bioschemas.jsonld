      "sc:description": "Generating interoperable electronic case report forms using online codebooks.\n\nSemantic interoperability of clinical data requires the use of a common vocabulary, such as SNOMED-CT. Unfortunately, mapping data to such a terminology is time-consuming and requires expert knowledge of both the dataset and the terminology. A viable alternative can be the reuse of codebooks - published dataset definitions which, in some cases, have already been mapped to a terminology. We designed the iCRF Generator, a tool which makes it easy to generate interoperable electronic Case Report Forms for (currently) three major EDCs: OpenClinica 3, Castor and REDCap. The tool currently provides access to several codebooks stored online in Art-Decor, such as:.",
