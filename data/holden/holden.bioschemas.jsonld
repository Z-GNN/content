      "sc:description": "Detecting fabrication in large-scale molecular omics data | Fraud is a pervasive problem and can occur as fabrication, falsification, plagiarism or theft. The scientific community is not exempt from this universal problem and several studies have recently been caught manipulating or fabricating data. Current measures to prevent and deter scientific misconduct come in the form of the peer-review process and on-site clinical trial auditors. As recent advances in high-throughput omics technologies have moved biology into the realm of big-data, fraud detection methods must be updated for sophisticated computational fraud | In the financial sector, machine learning and digit-preference are successfully used to detect fraud | See our pre-press article at: https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/757070v1",
