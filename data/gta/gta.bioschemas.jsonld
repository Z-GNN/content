      "sc:description": "GTA_Hunter is a 'support-vector machine' (SVM) classifier that distinguishes gene transfer agent (GTA) genes from their viral homologs | The classifier was developed to detect GTA genes that are homologous to 11 of the genes that encode the GTA in Rhodobacter capsulatus (RcGTA) (see Kogay et al, 2019). However, the classifier can be trained to detect other RcGTA genes, other GTAs, or even other virus-like elements, as long as there is training data available and the two classes have distinct amino acid composition",
