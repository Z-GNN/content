      "sc:description": "Processing Big Data with application containers on Apache Spark.\n\nItalian, pronounced: /Ëˆmare/. Noun: Sea.\n\nMaRe has been developed with scientific application in mind. High-throughput methods produced massive datasets in the past decades, and using frameworks like Spark and Hadoop is a natural choice to enable high-throughput analysis. In scientific applications, many tools are highly optimized to resemble, or detect some phenomena that occur in a certain system. Hence, sometimes the effort of reimplementing scientific tools in Spark or Hadoop can't be sustained by research groups. MaRe aims to provide the means to run existing serial tools in MapReduce fashion. Since many of the available scientific tools are trivially parallelizable, MapReduce is an excellent paradigm that can be used to parallelize the computation.",
