  "http://schema.org/description": "<p>Acquiarium is for carrying out the common pipeline of many spatial cell studies using fluorescence microscopy. It addresses image capture, raw image correction, image segmentation, quantification of segmented objects and their spatial arrangement, volume rendering, and statistical evaluation. It is focused on quantification of spatial properties of many objects and their mutual spatial relations in a collection of many 3D images. It can be used for analysis of a collection of 2D images or time lapse series of 2D or 3D images as well. It has a modular design and is extensible via plug-ins. It is a stand-alone, easy to install application written in C++ language. The GUI is written using cross-platform wxWidgets library.</p>\r\n",
