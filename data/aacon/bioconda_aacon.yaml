description: AACon is a set of tools implementing 17 different conservation scores
  reviewed by Valdar as well as the more complex SMERFS algorithm for predicting protein
  functional sites. AACon has been written with efficiency in mind and takes less
  than a second to calculate conservation by all 18 methods for an alignment of 500
  sequences 350 residues long on a single CPU. AACon exploits parallelism for the
  more demanding methods and to allow multiple methods to run simultaneously. The
  parallel code gives close to linear speedup with the number of processors, thus
  making it suitable for server applications or other demanding environments.
