description: 'MACSE aligns coding NT sequences with respect to their AA translation
  while allowing NT sequences to contain

  multiple frameshifts and/or stop codons. MACSE is hence the first automatic solution
  to align protein-coding

  gene datasets containing non-functional sequences (pseudogenes) without disrupting
  the underlying codon

  structure. It has also proved useful in detecting undocumented frameshifts in public
  database sequences and

  in aligning next-generation sequencing reads/contigs against a reference coding
  sequence
