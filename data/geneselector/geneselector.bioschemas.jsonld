'Selected' genes are those present at the top of the list. The stability of the findings can be considered in the final ranking by examining perturbed versions of the original data set, e.g. by leaving samples, swapping class labels, generating bootstrap replicates or adding noise. Given multiple ranked lists, one can use aggregation methods to find a synthesis.",
