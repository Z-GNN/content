      "sc:description": "GPU acceleration of Darwin read overlapper for de novo assembly of long DNA reads.\n\nThis repository contains a GPU implementation of Darwin [1][2], a hardware-friendly DNA aligner.\n\nIt consists of two parts: D-SOFT and GACT, which represent typical seed-and-extend methods. D-SOFT (Diagonal-band based Seed Overlapping based Filtration Technique) filters the search space by counting non-overlapping bases in matching Kmers in a band of diagonals. GACT (Genomic Alignment using Constant Tracebackmemory) can align reads of arbitrary length using constant memory for the compute-intensive step.\n\nThis implementation can be used to run on CPU only, or use the GPU-accelerated version. For more choices between individual optimizations, go back to commit e472745e.",
