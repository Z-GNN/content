This has been initially developed for Clostridium difficile, but could be adpated to other bacteria.\n\nSingularity - instructions can be found here https://github.com/sylabs/singularity/blob/master/INSTALL.md.\n\nThis workflow will run on systems that support the dependencies above. It has been tested on MacOS, Ubuntu and CentOS. Minimal system resources are required to generate hash-cgMLST profiles alone, however generating assemblies using SPAdes is the main resource constraint for the whole pipeline, the amount of memory to use per core can be set in the nextflow.config file, e.g. 8 Gb.\n\nJava version 8 or later (required for nextflow).",
