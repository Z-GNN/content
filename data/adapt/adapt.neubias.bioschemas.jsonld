  "http://schema.org/description": "<p>ADAPT is capable of rapid, automated analysis of migration and membrane protrusions, together with associated<br />\r\nfluorescently labeled proteins, across multiple cells. ADAPT can detect and morphologically profile filopodia.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>ADAPT (Automated Detection and Analysis of ProTrusions) is a plug-in developed for the <a href=\"http://fiji.sc/Fiji\">ImageJ/Fiji</a> platform to automatically detect and analyse cell migration and morphodynamics. The program provides whole-cell analysis of multiple cells, while also returning data on individual membrane protrusion events. The plug-in accepts as input one or two image stacks and outputs a variety of data. ADAPT may also be run in batch mode.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n",
