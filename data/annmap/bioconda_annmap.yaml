description: 'annmap provides annotation mappings for Affymetrix exon arrays and coordinate
  based queries to support deep sequencing data analysis. Database access is hidden
  behind the API which provides a set of functions such as genesInRange(), geneToExon(),
  exonDetails(), etc. Functions to plot gene architecture and BAM file data are also
  provided. Underlying data are from Ensembl. The annmap database can be downloaded
  from: https://figshare.manchester.ac.uk/account/articles/16685071'
