description: 'Implement the HDF5Array, H5SparseMatrix, H5ADMatrix, and TENxMatrix
  classes, 4 convenient and memory-efficient array-like containers for representing
  and manipulating either: (1) a conventional (a.k.a. dense) HDF5 dataset, (2) an
  HDF5 sparse matrix (stored in CSR/CSC/Yale format), (3) the central matrix of an
  h5ad file (or any matrix in the /layers group), or (4) a 10x Genomics sparse matrix.
  All these containers are DelayedArray extensions and thus support all operations
  (delayed or block-processed) supported by DelayedArray objects.'
