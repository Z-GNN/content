description: Quantify and interpret multiple sources of biological and technical variation
  in gene expression experiments. Uses a linear mixed model to quantify variation
  in gene expression attributable to individual, tissue, time point, or technical
  variables.  Includes dream differential expression analysis for repeated measures.
