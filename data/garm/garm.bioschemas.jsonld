      "sc:description": "GARM (Genome Assembler, Reconcilation and Merging) is a new software pipeline to merge and reconcile assemblies from different algorithms or sequencing technologies. It relies on the observation that a combination of sequencing methods will work better together to reconstruct a genome in its totality, overcoming the limitations of each technology and assembly method if they were used in isolation. The pipeline is based on perl scripts and third-party open source software like the AMOS package.",
