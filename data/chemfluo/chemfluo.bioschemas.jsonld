      "sc:description": "ChemFLuo is a web-server for structure analysis and identification of fluorescent compounds. Fluorescent detection methods are indispensable tools for chemical biology. However, the undesirable effect induced by fluorescent compound interference has produced many false positive results, thus hampering the efficiency of drug development. In order to prescreen potential fluorescent interferences, we build a reliable prediction model based on a large data set. ChemFluo is a public webserver which could be useful to flag blue and green fluorescent compounds in large dataset.",
