description: Peak Detection in Mass Spectrometry data is one of the important preprocessing
  steps. The performance of peak detection affects subsequent processes, including
  protein identification, profile alignment and biomarker identification. Using Continuous
  Wavelet Transform (CWT), this package provides a reliable algorithm for peak detection
  that does not require any type of smoothing or previous baseline correction method,
  providing more consistent results for different spectra. See <doi:10.1093/bioinformatics/btl355}
  for further details.
