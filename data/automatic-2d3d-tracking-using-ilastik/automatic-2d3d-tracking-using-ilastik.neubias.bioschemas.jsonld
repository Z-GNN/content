  "http://schema.org/description": "<p>This workflow is used to track multiple (appear/disappear, dividing and merging) objects in presumably big 2D+t or 3D+t datasets. It is best suitable for roundish objects or spots. Tracking is done through segmentation, which can be obtained from ilastik pixel classification, or imported from other tools. Users should provide a few object level labels, and the software predicts results on the rest of the image or new images with similar image characteristics. As a result, all objects get assigned random IDs at the first frame of the image sequence and all descendants in the same track (also children objects such as daughter cells) inherit this ID.</p>\r\n",
