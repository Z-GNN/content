  "http://schema.org/description": "<p>Measurement of kymograph generally deals with slanted streaks in kymograph to measure velocity of movements. This is a pretty much manual procedure that needs hands-on work. Kymoquant analyzes kymograph by treating patterns appearing in kymograph as texture: for a specified area in kymograph, it detects the most likely orientation of streaks and outputs this result as velocity. This workflow was created to ease the situation when it is difficult to find major direction of streaks only with eyes.</p>\r\n",
