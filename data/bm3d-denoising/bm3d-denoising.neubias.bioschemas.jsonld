  "http://schema.org/description": "<p>BM3D is a recent denoising method based on the fact that an image has a locally sparse representation in transform domain. This sparsity is enhanced by grouping similar 2D image patches into 3D groups. In this paper we propose an open-source implementation of the method. We discuss the choice of all parameter methods and confirm their actual optimality. The description of the method is rewritten with a a more transparent notation that in the original paper. A final index gives nonetheless the correspondence between the new notation and the original notation.</p>\r\n",
