  "http://schema.org/description": "<p>A resident function in ImageJ, located in the menu as <strong>[Process &gt; Binary &gt; Voronoi]</strong>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Quote from the ImageJ reference page:</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>Splits the image by lines of points having equal distance to the borders of the two nearest particles. Thus, the Voronoi cell of each particle includes all points that are nearer to this particle than any other particle. When particles are single points, this process is a Voronoi tessellation (also known as Dirichlet tessellation). The output type (Overwrite, 8-bit, 16-bit or 32-bit) of this command can be set in the [Process &gt; Binary &gt; Options...] dialog box. In the output, the value inside the Voronoi cells is zero; the pixel values of the dividing lines between the cells are equal to the distance between the two nearest particles. This is similar to a medial axis transform of the background, but there are no lines in inner holes of particles.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n",
