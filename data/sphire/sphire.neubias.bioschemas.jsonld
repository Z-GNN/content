  "http://schema.org/description": "<p><span>SPHIRE is a new software suite designed for easy access to cryo electron microscopy with the clear goal of quality assessment and result reproducibility by statistical resampling. While being well suited for cryo-EM novices, experienced users will find comfort in the accessibility of almost every possible variable in advanced option tabs and the transparent, easily customizable Python-based framework for non-standard processing pipelines. In a visually appealing and easy-to-use graphical user interface (GUI) the user will find an array of programs which will guide through the complete process of high-resolution cryo-EM. This begins with movie frame alignments (movie), CTF estimation of raw electron micrographs (cter) and picking/stack creation (window) and continues with reproducible 2-D classification (isac), reproducible initial model generation (viper), automatic gold-standard 3-D refinement (meridien), local resolution estimation and filtering (localres), up to the 3-D sorting of different conformational states based on the statistical 3-D variability of the data (sort3D). </span></p>\r\n",
