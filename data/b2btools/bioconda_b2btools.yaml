description: 'This package provides you with structural predictions for protein sequences
  made by the Bio2Byte group which researches the relation between protein sequence
  and biophysical behavior.


  List of available predictors:

  1. Dynamine: Fast predictor of protein backbone dynamics using only sequence information
  as input. The version here also predicts side-chain dynamics and secondary structure
  predictors using the same principle.

  2. Disomine: Predicts protein disorder with recurrent neural networks not directly
  from the amino acid sequence, but instead from more generic predictions of key biophysical
  properties, here protein dynamics, secondary structure, and early folding.

  3. EfoldMine: Predicts from the primary amino acid sequence of a protein, which
  amino acids are likely involved in early folding events.

  4. AgMata: Single-sequence-based predictor of protein regions that are likely to
  cause beta-aggregation.

  5. PSPer: PSP (Phase Separating Protein) predicts whether a protein is likely to
  phase-separate with a particular mechanism involving RNA interacts (FUS-like proteins).

  6. ShiftCrypt: Auto-encoding NMR chemical shifts from their native vector space
  to a residue-level biophysical index.
