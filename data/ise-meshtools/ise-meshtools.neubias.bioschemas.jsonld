  "http://schema.org/description": "<p>ISE-MeshTools is a software designed by Renaud Lebrun, from the university of Montpellier II. ISE-MeshTools is a system for the processing and editing of series of 3D triangular meshes. The system provides a set of tools for editing, positioning, deforming, labelling, measuring and rendering sets of 3D meshes. Features include:  Retrodeformation for un-deforming fossils/deformed specimens  Point and curve primitives for placing the exact type of landmark points youre interested in  Easy to use 3D interface for positioning and manipulating sets of surfaces and landmark primitives  Mesh tagging, labelling and colouring (to allow for the creation of anatomy atlases)  Mesh scalar computation and colouring (based upon curvature/thickness etc...)
