description: The package implements GUIDE-seq and PEtag-seq analysis workflow including
  functions for filtering UMI and reads with low coverage, obtaining unique insertion
  sites (proxy of cleavage sites), estimating the locations of the insertion sites,
  aka, peaks, merging estimated insertion sites from plus and minus strand, and performing
  off target search of the extended regions around insertion sites with mismatches
  and indels.
