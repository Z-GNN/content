  "http://schema.org/description": "<p>Bio-Formats is a standalone Java library for reading and writing life sciences image file formats. It is capable of parsing both pixels and metadata for a large number of formats, as well as writing to several formats. The primary goal of Bio-Formats is to facilitate the exchange of microscopy data between different software packages and organizations. It achieves this by converting proprietary microscopy data into an open standard called the OME Data Model, particularly into the OME-TIFF file format. ### Command Line Tools Bioformats could also be used as stand alone application from command line. See [Bioformats command line tools introduction.](http://www.openmicroscopy.org/site/support/bio-formats5/users/comlinetools/)</p>\r\n",
