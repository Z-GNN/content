description: This package implements a Naive Bayes classifier for accurately differentiating
  true polyadenylation sites (pA sites) from oligo(dT)-mediated 3' end sequencing
  such as PAS-Seq, PolyA-Seq and RNA-Seq by filtering out false polyadenylation sites,
  mainly due to oligo(dT)-mediated internal priming during reverse transcription.
  The classifer is highly accurate and outperforms other heuristic methods.
