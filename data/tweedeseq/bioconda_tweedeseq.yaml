description: Differential expression analysis of RNA-seq using the Poisson-Tweedie
  (PT) family of distributions. PT distributions are described by a mean, a dispersion
  and a shape parameter and include Poisson and NB distributions, among others, as
  particular cases. An important feature of this family is that, while the Negative
  Binomial (NB) distribution only allows a quadratic mean-variance relationship, the
  PT distributions generalizes this relationship to any orde.
