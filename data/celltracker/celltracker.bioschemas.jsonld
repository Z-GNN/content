      "sc:description": "CellTracker is an automated toolbox for single-cell segmentation and tracking of time-lapse microscopy images. CellTracker is a highly integrated graphical user interface software, for automated cell segmentation and tracking of time-lapse microscopy images. It covers essential steps in image analysis including project management, image pre-processing, cell segmentation, cell tracking, manually correction, and statistical analysis such as the quantification of cell size and fluorescence intensity, etc. Furthermore, CellTracker provides an annotation tool and supports model training from scratch, thus proposing a flexible and scalable solution for customized dataset analysis.",
