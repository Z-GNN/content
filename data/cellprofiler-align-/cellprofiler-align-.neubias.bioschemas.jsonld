  "http://schema.org/description": "**Align** aligns images relative to each other, for example, to correct\r\nshifts in the optical path of a microscope in each channel of a\r\nmulti-channel set of images.  \r\n\r\nFor two or more input images, this module determines the optimal\r\nalignment among them. Aligning images is useful to obtain proper\r\nmeasurements of the intensities in one channel based on objects\r\nidentified in another channel, for example. Alignment is often needed\r\nwhen the microscope is not perfectly calibrated. It can also be useful\r\nto align images in a time-lapse series of images. The module stores the\r\namount of shift between images as a measurement, which can be useful for\r\nquality control purposes.  \r\n\r\nNote that the second image (and others following) is always aligned with\r\nrespect to the first image. That is, the X/Y offsets indicate how much\r\nthe second image needs to be shifted by to match the first.\r\nThis module does not perform warping or rotation, it simply shifts images\r\nin X and Y. For more complex registration tasks, you might preprocess\r\nimages using a plugin for that purpose in FIJI/ImageJ.\r\n\r\n| Supports 2D? | Supports 3D? | Respects masks? |  \r\n|--------------|--------------|-----------------|\r\n| Yes          | No           | Yes             | \r\n\r\n\r\n### Measurements made by this module\r\n\r\n-  *Xshift, Yshift:* The pixel shift in X and Y of the aligned image\r\n   with respect to the original image.\r\n\r\n### References\r\n\r\n-  Lewis JP.
