      "sc:description": "Rotationally Invariant Exponential Family PCA.\n\nIn photon-limited imaging, the pixel intensities are affected by photon count noise. Many applications require an accurate estimation of the covariance of the underlying 2-D clean images. For example, in X-ray free electron laser (XFEL) single molecule imaging, the covariance matrix of 2-D diffraction images is used to reconstruct the 3-D molecular structure. Accurate estimation of the covariance from low-photon-count images must take into account that pixel intensities are Poisson distributed, hence the classical sample covariance estimator is highly biased. Moreover, in single molecule imaging, including in-plane rotated copies of all images could further improve the accuracy of covariance estimation. In this paper we introduce an efficient and accurate algorithm for covariance matrix estimation of count noise 2-D images, including their uniform planar rotations and possibly reflections",
