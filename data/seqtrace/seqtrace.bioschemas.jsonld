  "sc:description": "Application for viewing and processing DNA sequencing chromatograms (trace files). SeqTrace makes it easy to quickly generate high-quality finished sequences from a large number of trace files. SeqTrace can automatically identify, align, and compute consensus sequences from matching forward and reverse traces, filter low-quality base calls, and perform end trimming of finished sequences. The finished DNA sequences can then be exported to common sequence file formats, such as FASTA.",
