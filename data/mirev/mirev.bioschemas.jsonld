      "sc:description": "miREV is an online database and tool to uncover potential reference RNAs and biomarkers in small-RNA sequencing data sets from Extracellular Vesicles enriched samples. miREV was developed as an easy to use online tool with a graphical user interface. Main goal is to uncover potential reference RNAs from EV studies in relation to different experimental conditions. Because suitable reference RNAs, for instance to validate findings from NGS experiments or to perform meaningful expression analyses by RT-qPCR, can vary from study to study because the RNA fingerprint strongly depends on the kind of experimental methods used. miREV also serves as a database. Interested parties can download the raw read counts and the associated metadata for further analyzes.",
