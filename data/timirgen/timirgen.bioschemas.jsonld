      "sc:description": "TimiRGeN is a R/Bioconductor package for time series microRNA-mRNA integration and analysis. TimiRGeN (Time Incorporated miR-mRNA Generation of Networks) is a novel R package which functionally analyses and integrates time course miRNA-mRNA differential expression data. This tool can generate small networks within R or export results into cytoscape or pathvisio for more detailed network construction and hypothesis generation. This tool is created for researchers that wish to dive deep into time series multi-omic datasets. TimiRGeN goes further than many other tools in terms of data reduction. Here, potentially hundreds of thousands of potential miRNA-mRNA interactions can be whittled down into a handful of high confidence miRNA-mRNA interactions effecting a signalling pathway, across a time course.",
