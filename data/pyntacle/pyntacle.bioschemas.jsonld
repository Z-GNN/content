  "sc:description": "Pyntacle is a Python package and a command-line tool that eases the analysis of graphs. Its main goal is the search for important components of graphs and the way it does it is based on topological indices which are tailored to the concepts of reachability, fragmentation, and centrality. It implements and provides ancillary methods for community finding, set operations between graphs, and quick data type conversion tools. Pyntacle relies on multi-core/process programming paradigms to speedup the execution of complex analysis routines.",
