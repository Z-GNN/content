The application focuses on the use of high-throughput data to detect ncRNAs, such as lncRNAs and microRNAs, as novel diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers. For a more comprehensive analysis, a large amount of public expression profile data with clinical follow-up information. TTSurv also provides flexible methods such as a minimum p-value algorithm and unsupervised clustering methods that can classify thoracic cancer samples into different risk groups.",
