  "sc:description": "The Swiss Variant Interpretation Platform (SVIP) aims at providing a centralized, joint, and curated knowledge base for the clinical interpretation of somatic variants coming from Swiss hospitals. For characterized variants, annotations are revised by a clinical expert panel. For the uncharacterized variants, manual curation is performed using bioinformatics tools and literature triage. The resulting annotations and their clinical interpretations are validated by a clinical expert panel.",
