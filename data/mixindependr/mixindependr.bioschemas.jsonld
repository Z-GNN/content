Basic genetic parameters like allele frequency, genotype frequency, heterozygosity and Hardy-Weinberg test of mixed genetic data can be obtained. In addition, a new test for mutual independence which is compatible for mixed genetic data is developed in this package.\n\nThe goal of mixIndependR is to test the mutual independence of mixed genetic markers.",
