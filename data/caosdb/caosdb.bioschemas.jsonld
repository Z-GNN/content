  "sc:description": "CaosDB is a software toolbox for data management. Its focus lies on managing data in dynamic environments of research and development where changes are too frequent or projects are too small to bear the great cost of implementing a traditional specialized and but inflexible data management system. The research data management system (RDMS) CaosDB uses a semantic data model that allows to grow and change in those dynamic environments!",
