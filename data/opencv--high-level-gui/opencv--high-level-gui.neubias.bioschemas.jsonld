  "http://schema.org/description": "<p>While OpenCV was designed for use in full-scale applications and can be used within functionally rich UI frameworks (such as Qt*, WinForms*, or Cocoa*) or without any UI at all, sometimes there it is required to try functionality quickly and visualize the results. This is what the HighGUI module has been designed for.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It provides easy interface to:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Create and manipulate windows that can display images and \"remember\" their content (no need to handle repaint events from OS).</li>\r\n\t<li>Add trackbars to the windows, handle simple mouse events as well as keyboard commands.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n",
