      "sc:description": "Identifying DNA-Binding Proteins and RNA-Binding Proteins Based on Multi-Label Learning Model and Motif-Based Convolutional Neural Network.\n\nA new sequence-based computational predictor for identifying DNA-binding proteins and RNA-binding proteins. In which, multi-label learning and a novel motif-based convolution neural network were employed. It reduced the cross prediction between DNA-binding proteins and RNA-binding proteins and improved the predictive perfermance for identification of DNA-binding proteins and RNA-binding proteins. It is a useful tool for nucleic acid binding protein prediction. The framework and working process of iDRBP_MMC are shown in Fig.1.",
