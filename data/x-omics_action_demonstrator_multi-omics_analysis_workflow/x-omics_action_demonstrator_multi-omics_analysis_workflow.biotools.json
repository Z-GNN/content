    "description": "This multi-omics data analysis workflow was developed as part of a case study investigating shared patterns between multi-omics data and childhood externalizing behaviour. The modular Nextflow workflow was implemented using FAIR practices. It comprises genome-wide DNA methylation, targeted metabolomics and behaviour data pre-processing, and integrative analysis methods. Individuals of a cohort are clustered using Similarity Network Fusion (SNF), latent feature dimensions are uncovered using different unsupervised methods including Multi-Omics Factor Analysis (MOFA) and Multiple Correspondence Analysis (MCA), and correlations between -omics and phenotype dimensions are determined in downstream analyses including results visualisation.",
