  "sc:description": "Spatial segmentation, obtained by clustering MSI pixels according to their mass spectral similarities, is a popular approach to automate ROI definition. Here we report a multimodal fusion strategy to enable an objective and trustworthy selection of \\#Clusters by utilizing additional information from corresponding histology images. Our work will greatly facilitate MSI-mediated spatial lipidomics, metabolomics, and proteomics research by providing intelligent software to automatically and reliably generate ROIs.",
