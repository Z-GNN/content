description: Efficient implementations for analyzing pre-clinical multiple drug combination
  datasets. It provides efficient implementations for 1.the popular synergy scoring
  models, including HSA, Loewe, Bliss, and ZIP to quantify the degree of drug combination
  synergy; 2. higher order drug combination data analysis and synergy landscape visualization
  for unlimited number of drugs in a combination; 3. statistical analysis of drug
  combination synergy and sensitivity with confidence intervals and p-values; 4. synergy
  barometer for harmonizing multiple synergy scoring methods to provide a consensus
  metric of synergy; 5. evaluation of synergy and sensitivity simultaneously to provide
  an unbiased interpretation of the clinical potential of the drug combinations. Based
  on this package, we also provide a web application (http://www.synergyfinder.org)
  for users who prefer graphical user interface.
