description: Nerpa is a tool for linking biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) to known
  nonribosomal peptides (NRPs). BGCs are predicted in genome sequences (FASTA or GBK)
  with antiSMASH (Medema et al, 2011). Known NRPs are accepted in the SMILES format
  and processed with rBAN (Ricart et al, 2019).
