      "sc:description": "a web server for allele-specific sgRNA design in precision medicine | Abstract Allele-specific targeting by CRISPR provides a point of entry for personalized gene therapy of dominantly inherited diseases, by selectively disrupting the mutant alleles or disease-causing single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), ideally while leaving normal alleles intact. Despite unprecedented specificity and tremendous therapeutic utility of allele-specific targeting by CRISPR, few bioinformatic tools have been implemented for the allele-specific purpose. We thus developed AsCRISPR ( A llele- s pecific CRISPR ), a web tool to aid the design of guide sequences that can discriminate between alleles. It can process with query sequences harboring single-base or short insertion-deletion (indel) mutations, as well as heterozygous SNPs deposited in the dbSNP database. Multiple CRISPR nucleases and their engineered variants including newly-developed Cas12b and CasX are included for usersâ€™ choice",
