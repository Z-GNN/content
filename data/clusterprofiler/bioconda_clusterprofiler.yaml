description: This package supports functional characteristics of both coding and non-coding
  genomics data for thousands of species with up-to-date gene annotation. It provides
  a univeral interface for gene functional annotation from a variety of sources and
  thus can be applied in diverse scenarios. It provides a tidy interface to access,
  manipulate, and visualize enrichment results to help users achieve efficient data
  interpretation. Datasets obtained from multiple treatments and time points can be
  analyzed and compared in a single run, easily revealing functional consensus and
  differences among distinct conditions.
