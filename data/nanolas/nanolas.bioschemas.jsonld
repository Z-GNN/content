      "sc:description": "a Comprehensive Nanobody Database with Data Integration, Consolidation, and Application.\n\nNanobodies, a unique subclass of antibodies first discovered in camelid animals, are composed solely of a single heavy chainâ€™s variable region (VHH). Their significantly reduced molecular weight, in comparison to conventional antibodies, confers numerous advantages in the treatment of various diseases. As research and applications involving nanobodies expand, the quantity of identified nanobodies is also rapidly growing. However, the existing antibody databases are deficient in type and coverage, failing to satisfy the comprehensive needs of researchers and thus, impeding progress in nanobody research. In response to this, we have amalgamated data from multiple sources to successfully assemble a new and comprehensive nanobody database",
