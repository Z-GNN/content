  "http://schema.org/description": "<p>Outline The incessant development of improved microscopy imaging techniques, as well as the advent of highly selective fluorescent dyes has made possible the precise identification of tagged molecules in almost any biological specimen. Of particular interest are the visualization and the study of living cells, which induce tight constraints on the imaging process. To avoid the alteration of the sample and to achieve a high temporal resolution, low fluorophore concentrations, low-power illumination and short exposure time need to be used in practice. Such restrictions have a tremendous impact on the image quality. This is why we have recently introduced a new method, coined PURE-LET [1,2,3], for efficient, fast, and automatic denoising of multidimensional fluorescence microscopy images.</p>\r\n",
