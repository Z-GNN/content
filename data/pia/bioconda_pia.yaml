description: 'PIA allows you to inspect the results of common proteomics spectrum
  identification

  search engines, combine them seamlessly and conduct statistical analyses. The main

  focus of PIA lays on the integrated inference algorithms, i.e. concluding the proteins

  from a set of identified spectra. But it also allows you to inspect your peptide

  spectrum matches, calculate FDR values across different search engine results and

  visualize the correspondence between PSMs, peptides and proteins.
