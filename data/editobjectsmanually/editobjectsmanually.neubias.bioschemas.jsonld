  "http://schema.org/description": "<p>The interface will show the image that you selected as the guiding image, overlaid with colored outlines of the selected objects (or filled objects if you choose). This module allows you to remove or edit specific objects by pointing and clicking to select objects for removal or editing. Once editing is complete, the module displays the objects as originally identified (left) and the objects that remain after this module (right). More detailed Help is provided in the editing window via the ‘?’ button. The pipeline pauses once per processed image when it reaches this module. You must press the&nbsp;<em>Done</em>&nbsp;button to accept the selected objects and continue the pipeline.</p>\r\n",
