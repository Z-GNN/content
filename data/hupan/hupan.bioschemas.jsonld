      "sc:description": "A pan-genome analysis pipeline for human genomes | Human pan-genome analysis pipeline | HUman PAN-genome analysis toolkit | The human reference genome is still incomplete, especially for those population-specific or individual-specific regions, which may have important functions. It encourages us to build the pan-genome of human population. Previously, our team developed a \"map-to-pan\" strategy, EUPAN, specific for eukaryotic pan-genome analysis. However, due to the large genome size of individual human genome, EUPAN is not suit for pan-genome analysis involving in hundreds of individual genomes. Here, we present an improved tool, HUPAN (HUman Pan-genome ANalysis), for human pan-genome analysis | The human reference genome is still incomplete, especially for those population-specific or individual-specific regions, which may have important functions | We propose HUPAN strategy primarily in the 185 deep sequencing and 90 assembled Han Chinese genomes",
