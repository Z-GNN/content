summary: PASA, acronym for Program to Assemble Spliced Alignments (and pronounced
  'pass-uh'), is a eukaryotic genome annotation tool that exploits spliced alignments
  of expressed transcript sequences to automatically model gene structures, and to
  maintain gene structure annotation consistent with the most recently available experimental
  sequence data. PASA also identifies and classifies all splicing variations supported
  by the transcript alignments.
version: 2.5.3
