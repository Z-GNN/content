      "sc:description": "Privacy-Preserving Tensor Factorization for Collaborative Health Data Analysis.\n\nTensor factorization has been demonstrated as an efficient approach for computational phenotyping, where massive electronic health records (EHRs) are converted to concise and meaningful clinical concepts. While distributing the tensor factorization tasks to local sites can avoid direct data sharing, it still requires the exchange of intermediary results which could reveal sensitive patient information. Therefore, the challenge is how to jointly decompose the tensor under rigorous and principled privacy constraints, while still support the model's interpretability. We propose DPFact, a privacy-preserving collaborative tensor factorization method for computational phenotyping using EHR. It embeds advanced privacy-preserving mechanisms with collaborative learning",
