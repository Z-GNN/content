  "http://schema.org/description": "<p>This plugin is used to infer the preferred orientation of structures present in the input image. It computes a histogram indicating the amount of structures in a given direction. Images with completely isotropic content are expected to give a flat histogram, whereas images in which there is a preferred orientation are expected to give a histogram with a peak at that orientation.&nbsp;On top of the histogram, the plugin tries to generate statistics on the highest peak found.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The plugin offers the possibility to generate an orientation map, where the image is colored according to its local directionality, or location orientation.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The plugin is part of Fiji, can be launched through the menu: Analyze &gt; Directionality</p>\r\n",
