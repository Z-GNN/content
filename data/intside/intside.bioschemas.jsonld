      "sc:description": "Drug side effects are one of the main health threats worldwide, and an important obstacle in drug development. Understanding how adverse reactions occur requires knowledge on drug mechanisms at the molecular level. Despite recent advances, the need for tools and methods that facilitate side effect anticipation still remains. IntSide is a web server to elucidate the molecular processes involved in drug side effects through the integration of chemistry and biology. IntSide currently catalogues 1,175 side effects caused by 996 drugs, associated with drug features divided into eight categories, belonging to either biology or chemistry. On the biological side, IntSide reports drug targets and off-targets, pathways, molecular functions and biological processes. From a chemical viewpoint, it includes molecular fingerprints, scaffolds and chemical entities.",
