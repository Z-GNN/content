It clusters GO terms using MCL based on overlapping ratios, OC (Overlap coefficient) or JC (Jaccard coefficient). The resulting clusters can be further analyzed and separated into sub-clusters using a second script, GOMCL-sub. This tool helps researchers to reduce time spent on manual curation of large lists of GO terms and minimize biases introduced by shared GO terms in data interpretation.",
