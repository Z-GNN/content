  description: pre-filter for querying very large collections of nucleotide sequences
  long_description: " Raptor is a system for approximately searching many queries\
    \ such as\n next-generation sequencing reads or transcripts in large collections\
    \ of\n nucleotide sequences. Raptor uses winnowing minimizers to define a set\
    \ of\n representative k-mers, an extension of the interleaved Bloom filters (IBFs)\
    \ as\n a set membership data structure and probabilistic thresholding for minimizers.\n\
    \ This approach allows compression and partitioning of the IBF to enable the\n\
    \ effective use of secondary memory.\n"
