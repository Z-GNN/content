  "http://schema.org/description": "<p>FoCuS-point is stand-alone software for TCSPC correlation and analysis. FoCuS-point utilizes advanced time-correlated single-photon counting (TCSPC) correlation algorithms along with time-gated filtering and innovative data visualization. The software has been designed to be highly user-friendly and is tailored to handle batches of data with tools designed to process files in bulk. FoCuS-point also includes advanced diffusion curve fitting algorithms which allow the parameters of the correlation functions and thus the kinetics of diffusion to be established quickly and efficiently.</p>\r\n",
