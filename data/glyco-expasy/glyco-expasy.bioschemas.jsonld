The philosophy is that it should be {glycoscientist AND protein scientist}â€“friendly with the aim of (1) popularizing the use of bioinformatics in glycobiology and (2) emphasizing the relationship between glycobiology and protein-oriented bioinformatics resources. Glyco@Expasy was designed with glycoscientists to meet the growing needs of the community for glycoinformatics.",
