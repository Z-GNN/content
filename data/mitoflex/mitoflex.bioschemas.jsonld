      "sc:description": "An efficient, high-performance toolkit for animal mitogenome assembly, annotation, and visualization.\n\nMitoFlex is a Python3 based toolkit designated for mitochondrial genome assembling, it's inspired from MitoZ, but with improved performance and result quality. And also it implemented a both easy and flexible mechanism to extend the program feature. It accepts both single-end and pair-end data, and follows an already set workflow to output results. Working mechanism is highly flexible and can be easily reconfigured here.",
