description: GREAT (Genomic Regions Enrichment of Annotations Tool) is a type of functional
  enrichment analysis directly performed on genomic regions. This package implements
  the GREAT algorithm (the local GREAT analysis), also it supports directly interacting
  with the GREAT web service (the online GREAT analysis). Both analysis can be viewed
  by a Shiny application. rGREAT by default supports more than 600 organisms and a
  large number of gene set collections, as well as self-provided gene sets and organisms
  from users. Additionally, it implements a general method for dealing with background
  regions.
