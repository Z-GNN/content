      "sc:description": "Whole-genome based Average Nucleotide Identity (gANI) is an effort to delineate species-level diversity among prokaryotic organisms in the genomic era. Microorganisms are evolving continuously and the signature of evolution is observed across its entire genome. As such, a single gene or a select group of marker genes should not be used to infer new species as it may not be a correct representation in the evolutionary landscape. Especially with the wealth of genomic information currently available, one needs to graduate from the gene-centric 16S based classification to a holistic, genome-based method.",
