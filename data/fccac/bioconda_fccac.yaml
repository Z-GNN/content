description: 'Computational evaluation of variability across DNA or RNA sequencing
  datasets is a crucial step in genomics, as it allows both to evaluate reproducibility
  of replicates, and to compare different datasets to identify potential correlations.
  fCCAC applies functional Canonical Correlation Analysis to allow the assessment
  of: (i) reproducibility of biological or technical replicates, analyzing their shared
  covariance in higher order components; and (ii) the associations between different
  datasets. fCCAC represents a more sophisticated approach that complements Pearson
  correlation of genomic coverage.'
