  "http://schema.org/description": "<p>By combining multiple image alignment and tracing into one program, Reconstruct (TM) allows images to be processed more efficiently. Tracing can be done directly on the transformed images and alignments can be asily modified. Reconstruct (TM) was developed from years of experience working with high magnification serial section images of brain tissue. (Extracted from User Manual)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\"The original platform of the Reconstruct program allows a user to trace objects in serial sections by manually drawing the outline of each object on each section, which is time-consuming. We modified Reconstruct to enable semi-automatic tracing of axons using a region-growing algorithm called wildfire.\"</p>\r\n",
