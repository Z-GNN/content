description: GCAT is an association test for genome wide association studies that
  controls for population structure under a general class of trait models.  This test
  conditions on the trait, which makes it immune to confounding by unmodeled environmental
  factors.  Population structure is modeled via logistic factors, which are estimated
  using the `lfa` package.
