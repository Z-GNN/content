biotools_id: classifyr
description: The software formalises a framework for classification and survival model
  evaluation in R. There are four stages; Data transformation, feature selection,
  model training, and prediction. The requirements of variable types and variable
  order are fixed, but specialised variables for functions can also be provided. The
  framework is wrapped in a driver loop that reproducibly carries out a number of
  cross-validation schemes. Functions for differential mean, differential variability,
  and differential distribution are included. Additional functions may be developed
  by the user, by creating an interface to the framework.
