      "sc:description": "ModelArchive is the archive for structural models which are not based on experimental data and complements the PDB archive for experimental structures and PDB-Dev for integrative structures. Any type of macromolecular structure which would otherwise be suitable for the PDB but whose coordinates are not based on experimental data can be deposited in ModelArchive. This includes single chains or complexes consisting of proteins, RNA, DNA, or carbohydrates including small molecules bound to them. The modelling methods can be pure in silico predictions as found in de novo models or based on experimental structures such as homology models or modified structures including docked ligands, modelled variants, post-translational modifications (e.g. glycosylated structures), etc. The main purpose of a deposited model is to supplement a manuscript for which the model was generated and to make the model accessible to the interested reader.",
