      "sc:description": "ARES-GT is a python script that identify CRISPR targets in query sequences (in FASTA format) and can also identify CRISPR targets matching multiple genes. Several online CRISPR tools exists with very good performance, however only a set of availables genomes can be selected (in some cases only a few, though in some tools more than 1500 can be selected) but none of them can identify sequences to be able to target multiple genes. This work usually needs manual (an slow) evaluation of alignments and offtargets.",
