Please cite the paper if you use DMPfold | You can also run DMPfold via the PSIPRED web server. This is a good way to get models for a few sequences, but if you want to run DMPfold on many sequences we strongly recommend you run it locally. The server version of DMPfold has restrictions on run time and uses parameters that give faster runs, so should not be used to benchmark DMPfold",
