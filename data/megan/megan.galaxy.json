    "Description": "MEGAN Community Edition - Interactive exploration and analysis of large-scale microbiome sequencing data.  MEGAN is a tool for studying the taxonomic content of a set of DNA reads, typically collected in a metagenomics project.In a preprocessing step, a sequence alignment of all reads against a suitable database of reference DNA or proteinsequences must be performed to produce an input file for the program. MEGAN is suitable for DNA reads (metagenomedata), RNA reads (metatranscriptome data), peptide sequences (metaproteomics data) and, using a suitable synonymsfile that maps SILVA ids to taxon ids, for 16S rRNA data (amplicon sequencing).",

    "bio.tool_description": "Metagenome Analysis Software - MEGAN (MEtaGenome ANalyzer¬ù) is a new computer program that allows laptop analysis of large metagenomic datasets. In a preprocessing step, the set of DNA reads (or contigs) is compared against databases of known sequences using BLAST or another comparison tool. MEGAN can then be used to compute and interactively explore the taxonomical content of the dataset, employing the NCBI taxonomy to summarize and order the results.",
