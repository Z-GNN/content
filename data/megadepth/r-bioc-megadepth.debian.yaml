  description: BioCOnductor BigWig and BAM related utilities
  long_description: " This package provides an R interface to Megadepth by Christopher\n\
    \ Wilks available at https://github.com/ChristopherWilks/megadepth. It is\n particularly\
    \ useful for computing the coverage of a set of genomic regions\n across bigWig\
    \ or BAM files. With this package, you can build base-pair\n coverage matrices\
    \ for regions or annotations of your choice from BigWig\n files. Megadepth was\
    \ used to create the raw files provided by\n https://bioconductor.org/packages/recount3.\n"
