Here, we explore how to use this comprehensive mapping of chemical biology space to support the development of large-scale quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) models. We propose a new deep learning consensus architecture (DLCA) that combines consensus and multitask deep learning approaches together to generate large-scale QSAR models.",
