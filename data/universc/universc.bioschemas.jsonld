UniverSC is a universal single-cell processing tool that supports any UMI-based platform. Our command-line tool enables consistent and comprehensive integration, comparison, and evaluation across data generated from a wide range of platforms. Here we provide a guide to install and use this tool to process single-cell RNA-Seq data from FASTQ format.",
