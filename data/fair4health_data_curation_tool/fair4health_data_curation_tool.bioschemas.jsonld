  "sc:description": "This is a standalone, desktop application developed by the FAIR4Health project (https://www.fair4health.eu/). The tool is used to connect the health data sources which can be in various formats (Excel files, CSV files, SQL databases) and migrate data into a HL7 FHIR Repository. The tool shows the available FHIR profiles to the user so that he/she can perform mappings appropriately. The tool can also contact a Terminology Server (which is actually another HL7 FHIR Repository) so that data fields can be annotated if coding schemes such as ICD10 or SNOMED-CT are in use.",
