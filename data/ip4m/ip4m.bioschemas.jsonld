Many integrated multi-functional tools have been developed for untargeted metabolomics data processing and have been widely used. More alternative platforms are expected for both basic and advanced users. RESULTS:Integrated mass spectrometry-based untargeted metabolomics data mining (IP4M) software was designed and developed",
