  "http://schema.org/description": "<p>Tracking&nbsp;tools, such as TrackMate, produce tracks and their role stops there. However, tracks are just an intermediate data structure in the workflow. Their subsequent&nbsp;analysis produces the numbers upon which scientific conclusions are made. The&nbsp;track analysis is most often specific to the scientific&nbsp;question to be addressed, and therefore tracking tools remain generic and seldom include&nbsp;specialized analysis modules. Another toolset is required for track analysis;&nbsp;this workflow&nbsp;focuses&nbsp;on using MATLAB.</p>\r\n",
