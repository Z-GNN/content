      "sc:description": "Comprehensive evaluation of deep learning architectures for prediction of DNA/RNA sequence binding specificities | End-to-end deep learning toolkit for predicting protein binding sites and motifs | deepRAM is an end-to-end deep learning toolkit for predicting protein binding sites and motifs. It helps users run experiments using many state-of-the-art deep learning methods and addresses the challenge of selecting model parameters in deep learning models using a fully automatic model selection strategy. This helps avoid hand-tuning and thus removes any bias in running experiments, making it user friendly without losing its flexibility. While it was designed with ChIP-seq and CLIP-seq data in mind, it can be used for any DNA/RNA sequence binary classification problem",
