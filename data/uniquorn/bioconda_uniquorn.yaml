description: '''Uniquorn'' enables users to identify cancer cell lines. Cancer cell
  line misidentification and cross-contamination reprents a significant challenge
  for cancer researchers. The identification is vital and in the frame of this package
  based on the locations/ loci of somatic and germline mutations/ variations. The
  input format is vcf/ vcf.gz and the files have to contain a single cancer cell line
  sample (i.e. a single member/genotype/gt column in the vcf file).'
