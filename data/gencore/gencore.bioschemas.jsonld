      "sc:description": "an efficient tool to generate consensus reads for error suppressing and duplicate removing of NGS data.\n\nGenerate consensus reads to reduce sequencing noises and remove duplications.\n\nA fast tool to remove sequencing duplications and eliminate sequencing errors by generating consensus reads.\n\ngencore is a tool for fast and powerful deduplication for paired-end next-generation sequencing (NGS) data. It is much faster and uses much less memory than Picard and other tools. It generates very informative reports in both HTML and JSON formats. It's based on an algorithm for generating consensus reads, and that's why it's named gencore",
